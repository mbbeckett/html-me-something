            <h2>What makes a bad movie? Is it poorly directed action scenes? Lackluster dialogue? Cheap digital effects? Though they may be lacking 
            in quality, they certainly do not lack heart. Here are a few recommendations for those who are willing to sit through them:</h2>
            <br>
                <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt00368226/">1. The Room (2003)</a></h3>
                    <p>You cannot talk about bad movies without mentioning <em>The Room</em>. Youâ€™d think <em>The Room</em> was <em>The Godfather</em> of bad movies. The plot surrounds the 
                    protagonist Johnny and his personal relationships with his long-time partner Lisa and best friend Mark. This story of full of romance, betrayal, sex scenes that go on for an uncomfortable period of time, 
                    unexplained drug deals, pictures of spoons, and a doggy! <em>The Room</em> garnered a cult following as a "midnight movie" shortly after its release in the early 2000s. 
                    The 2017 movie <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521126/"> The Disaster Artist</a></em> introduced <em>The Room</em> to a broader audience.</p>

            <br>
                <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105643/">2. Troll 2 (1990)</a></h3>
                    <p>OH MY GOOOOOD! Another heavy hitter! Despite the name, <em>Troll 2</em> is actually a standalone movie. It also lacks a titular troll. 
                    In the film, a family on vacation find themselves victims to a town full 
                    of <em>goblins...</em>. There is a documentary about the movie called <em><a href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1144539/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3>Best Worst Movie</a></em> created by one of the actors about the making of Troll 2 
                    and its status as a cult film.</p>

               <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099700/">3. Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)</a></h3>
                    <p>I have long declared myself a fan of sequels (more like "squeak-quels"). The majority of them don't seem to quite make the mark and that's what I love about them. I take 
                    pride in the fact that I've never seen the first Gremlins. The second film was enough to satiate my need to view bloodthirsty 
                    furbees take to the screen to perform "New York, New York". This movie has it all. An opening credits sequence starring Bugs 
                    Bunny and Daffy Duck, the legendary Christopher Lee as a mad scientist, a gremlin turning into a spider set to Slayer's "Angel of Death", 
                    and Leonard Maltin being attacked and eaten by Gremlins. Top that, Marvel.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089907/">4. Return of the Living Dead (1985)</a></h3>
                    <p>Ever since I was a kid, I loved horror films. Horror movies tend to be cheaper to make, therein creating a recipe for disaster. Most horror franchises are full of unnecessary sequels and bad reboots. This franchise is no exception. 
                    Still, this film is a fun watch. Punks vs. zombies. Who wouldn't enjoy this movie? I'd also recommend it for the soundtrack, featuring bands like 45 Grave and the Cramps. <br>

                <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/">5. Birdemic (2010)</a></h3>
                    <p>Before <em>Sharknado</em>, there was <em>Birdemic</em>. The director has said the film was created to warn audiences of the harms caused by global warming. It has been described 
                    as &#34;<em>The Birds</em> meets <em>An Inconvienient Truth</em>&#34; but, you know... <strong>terrible...</strong></p>
